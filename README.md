# WorkManagerPOC

This is a POC to show that the Work Manager can start up a service when the app is terminated at pre-defined times.


to use the app, first install on your testing device.
add the specified time to run the service via the edit texts in the correct format, completely turn off and terminate the app from the background and wait for the Work Manager to start/close the service.


The Work Manager runs every 15min (smallest interval)
